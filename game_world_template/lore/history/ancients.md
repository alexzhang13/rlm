# Resonance of the Ancients
The Ancients guarded their caves with Golems made of pure crystal. 

LIBRARIAN NOTE: These entities are impervious to physical blades. However, they are internally tuned to **440Hz**. A concentrated burst of resonance at this frequency will bypass their physical shell and damage their core directly.
