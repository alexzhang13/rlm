Divide-and-conquer test. Compute the sum of squares of the numbers 1..32.
You MUST do this via the REPL using recursive llm_query calls:
1) In REPL, split the range into two halves and call llm_query on each half.
2) Each sub-LLM should again split its half and call llm_query (one more level).
3) The leaf sub-LLMs should compute sums directly and return them.
4) Aggregate the results and return FINAL(sum).
Use llm_query_batched if helpful.
